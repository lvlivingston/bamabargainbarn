### **Tech Stack**
It's a responsive eCommerce web application (soon to be hosted on Heroku) utilizing Django with Python, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and the payments API from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/development/quickstart?lang=python).

###### **API Details**
The [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/implementation-guides/core-payments) payments API is connected via test mode only. Currently, I have successfully connected to the API, setup a shopping cart, checkout, and pay views. With the test credit card information, it's possible to see the successful and cancel payment paths, but there is a small issue with the webhook that needs to be debugged to update inventory and clear out the shopping cart after purchase.

### **Tech Stack**

My goal for the capstone project was to add a well-rounded fourth piece to my Github portfolio. The idea was to create a responsive eCommerce web application hosted on Heroku utilizing Django with Python, React, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and the payments API from Stripe.

###### **API Details**

The [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/implementation-guides/core-payments) payments API will be connected via test mode only. Currently, I have successfully connected to the API, but haven't created the user view yet.
